    "In Level 2, we see more flexibility and additional choices. You will be exposed to some simple Python code and see how Aviary establishes a problem from beginning to end. Each step is built upon the capabilities of [Level 3](onboarding_level3). Users will be led to Level 3 in a natural way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 2 is defined in the [aviary/interface/methods_for_level1.py file](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/interface/methods_for_level1.py) and it has a single method `run_aviary()` with a few arguments. If you examine `interface/level1.py` you see that Level 1 prepares those arguments and then call `run_aviary()`. For `aviary run_mission aircraft_for_bench_GwGm` examples, those arguments are:\n",

    "All the above arguments are straightforward except `objective_type`. Even though `objective_type` is `None`, it is not treated as `None`. In this scenario, the objective is set based on `problem_type` when using the GASP-based mission method, but not the FLOPS-based mission. There are three options for `problem_type`.

As you can see, since `problem_type` is `SIZING` by default in our case and we don't manually alter this setting, Aviary set objective to `Mission.Objectives.FUEL`. We will discuss more options of `objective_type` later on.\n",

This leads to the `hybrid_objective` which seeks to minimize a combination of those two objectives. `final_time` is the duration of the full mission and is usually in the range of hours. So, the denominator `5.` means `5 hours`. That's just a value to scale the final_time variable. Since it's a composite objective we didn't want to have OpenMDAO do the scaling because the two variables in the objective are of a different order of magnitude. We will show an example of this objective type in level 2 discussion.\n",
