    "Every variable in an Aviary variable hierarchy must have metadata associated with it. This metadata is used for setting initial values, setting Aviary inputs and outputs, and various other functionalities throughout the code. It is also helpful information for the user to have regarding each variable and the metadata dictionary allows all that information to live in one organized location. Unlike variable hierarchies, which are broken up into different categories based on the type of information they contain, the variable metadata all lives in the same dictionary, regardless of which variable hierarchy its variables come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable metadata dictionary is exactly what it sounds like: a Python dictionary, or more explicitly a Python dictionary of dictionaries. The entire metadata is one dictionary, and within that metadata dictionary each variable has its own sub-dictionary including all the information relevant to that variable. The information included in each sub-dictionary is:\n",

As such there is only one Aviary-core metadata dictionary, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/variable_info/variable_meta_data.py) and accessed in the following way:"

    "In the Aviary-core metadata dictionary, due to the size of the data we have adopted a structure of organizing the metadata alphabetically by variable hierarchy. Thus, while all the variables are part of the same metadata dictionary, you will notice that the organization structure of the file is the same alphabetical hierarchal organization structure as the Aviary-core variable hierarchy. This is a convention that we encourage to improve the cleanliness of code, but it is not strictly required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Your Own Metadata\n",
    "Unlike the variable hierarchies, which are separated out into different hierarchies for different types of data, there is only one metadata dictionary for all variables in every variable hierarchy. Technically the user may build a metadata dictionary from scratch instead of extending the Aviary-core metadata, however, there is no real value to this as you will eventually have to merge back in the Aviary-core metadata anyway, so there are no normal circumstances under which this is the recommended practice. However, just like with variable hierarchies, you can have several different metadata dictionaries which will eventually be merged together. This may be necessary when there are multiple people developing different external subsystems in different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to change the metadata in a metadata dictionary. The first is to add a new variable to the dictionary, and add that variable's metadata along with it. This makes use of the `add_meta_data()` function. This function takes in the variable name of the variable to be added to the metadata dictionary be provided, as well as the dictionary itself that the variable should be added to. It also optionally takes in all of the metadata information listed at the beginning of this page. The function returns nothing, but it internally updates the provided metadata dictionary so that dictionary will contain the new variable and its metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to change the metadata in a metadata dictionary is by updating the metadata associated with a variable that is already in the dictionary. This is accomplished using the `update_meta_data()` function. This function behaves almost identically to the `add_meta_data()` function, the only difference being that instead of adding a new variable to the dictionary, it will take the input of metadata information that you provide and overwrite the old metadata of the given variable with the new metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two pitfalls that may occur when using these functions. The first pitfall is attempting to call the `add_meta_data()` function for a variable that already exists in the metadata. This will throw an error, because the `add_meta_data()` function is only for new variables to the metadata. Conversely, attempting to update the metadata of a variable that is not in the metadata dictionary via `update_meta_data()` will throw an error because that function is only for variables that already exist in the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods outlined above for updating and adding to the variable metadata are the crux of how the variable metadata can be extended for new variables. The user will simply import the existing Aviary-core metadata and add to it as they see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The variable metadata dictionary that is imported from the Aviary API is actually a copy of the original Aviary metadata dictionary to avoid mutating the original dictionary. That being said, it functions just as a metadata dictionary that you would input to an Aviary model and you can extend it or input it to a model as-is depending on your needs.\n",
