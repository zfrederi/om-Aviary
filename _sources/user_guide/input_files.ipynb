    "## External Data Files\n",

    "\n",
    "Headers are information on variable name, and optionally units. Only one header can be present, and it must appear *before* the numerical performance data begins. The header consists of a comma separated list of variable names in the order they appear in the data table, with units optionally provided in parentheses after the variable name. Aviary supports the same [list of units](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/features/units.html) supported by OpenMDAO. \n",
    "If units are not specified, a default of 'unitless' is assumed, unless the user provides variable metadata when using the csv reading utility function. In that case, the default units of that variable in the metadata is used. This functionality is demonstrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in an external data file must be in column format, delimited by commas. Only numerical data that can be cast to type `float` is compatible with Aviary data tables at this time. An error will be raised if non-numerical data is present in the data file that is not a comment or a correctly formatted header."

Variables without specified units, or units of 'unitless' do not require units to be listed in the header to reduce clutter. When reading this csv back, Aviary will know to add units of 'unitless' to any variables without specified units. The exception is when using metadata to filter what data will be read, which will be demonstrated later on this page. Also, it can be seen both comments have the `#` as the first character, even though it was not included in the first comment given to the csv writer. Aviary handles comment formatting, so including a `#` character with comments is optional."

In addition, units specified in the data file are checked for compatibility with the default units for that variable. If units are not provided for a variable, default units are applied instead of always applying 'unitless'. Let's re-run the same code as before, but this time provide Aviary's core metadata to the reader. The expected behavior is for `Scale Factor` to be skipped, since it isn't in the variable hierarchy."

    "\n",
    "A second optional argument is `aliases`. This argument is used to map multiple possible header names to the same openMDAO variable. This is useful if your data files do not use Aviary variable names, or could contain multiple variants of names that all mean the same thing (such as 'height', 'alt', and 'altitude'). In this example, our data file has a header labeled `Scale Factor`, but we would like to map it to the more precise `aircraft:wing:mass_scaler`. The allowable header name matching is not case-sensitive and Aviary will treat spaces and underscores as identical, so `scale_factor` will match with `Scale Factor`. This improves ease-of-use. However, the variable name you want headers mapped to are case-sensitive, in case you are connecting to an external component that doesn't follow Aviary's [variable naming standards](../developer_guide/coding_standards.md). So if your alias dict contains `Final_Name: example_var`, any case combination of `example_var` will always return `Final_Name` capitalized as specified."
