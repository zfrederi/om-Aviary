    "# FLOPS Based Detailed Takeoff and Landing\n",
    "Aviary support of FLOPS based detailed takeoff and landing is implemented in terms of\n",
    "user options, initial guesses, and different types of builders. User options and initial guesses are often collected in `AviaryValues` objects, which are then used to setup different builders.

The following sections describe which builders are associated with takeoff and landing and how to generally use them.\n",

    "Both takeoff and landing are designed to use the FLOPS-derived `low_speed` aerodynamics method defined in the `CoreAerodynamicsBuilder`. The builder supports several options specified in a `subsystem_options` dictionary provided to the phase builder. The most important subsystem options are the three required sequences: `angles_of_attack`, `lift_coefficients`, and `drag_coefficients`. At least two values must be specified in `angles_of_attack`. For each value in `angles_of_attack`, there must be one dependent value at the corresponding index in each of `lift_coefficients` and `drag_coefficients`.\n",

In most cases, values like `angles_of_attack`, `lift_coefficients`, `drag_coefficients`, and a few others are identical across all phases of takeoff/landing trajectory, even if other option values vary by phase."
