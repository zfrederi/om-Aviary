    "\n",
    "## How to define a mission\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now discuss how to define the mission that we want the aircraft to fly.\n",
    "We could do this a few different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We could use the `default_simple_mission` file, which contains a default mission definition including climb, cruise, and descent\n",
    "- We could programmatically define the mission by defining a `phase_info` dictionary that contains the mission phases and their definitions\n",
    "- We could graphically define the mission using the `draw_mission` Aviary command\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, let's use the graphical interface to define our mission.\n",
    "It's the fastest method, is relatively intuitive, and results in generally less work for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawing a mission profile\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the graphical interface, open a command prompt (terminal window) and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "aviary draw_mission\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open a new window with two blank axes and some options and should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![blank flight profile](images/blank_flight_profile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Remember that we are defining a mission for a single-aisle commercial aircraft, so our mission definition here should reflect that.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is documented in the [drawing and running simple missions doc page](../user_guide/drawing_and_running_simple_missions).\n",
    "For now, we'll define a relatively simple mission with three phases: climb, cruise, and descent.\n",
    "We've clicked around on our end to make a reasonable flight profile and it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![flight profile](images/flight_profile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to draw your own flight profile or use the results of the one we've drawn here.\n",
    "The rest of the example will use the flight profile shown above, but you can replace the `phase_info` dict with your own if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we're done running the GUI, we hit the `Done` button in the top right corner and we should see output that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Total range is estimated to be 1915 nautical miles\n",
    "reformatted /mnt/c/Users/user/Dropbox/git/Aviary/outputted_phase_info.py\n",

    "Phase info has been saved and formatted in /mnt/c/Users/user/Dropbox/git/Aviary/outputted_phase_info.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) python autoformatter installed, your output may look slightly different - as long as you see confirmation that your phase info has been saved, your mission profile was successfully created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `phase_info` dictionary has been saved to a file called `outputted_phase_info.py` in the current directory.\n",
    "Let's dig into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examining the mission definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening the `outputted_phase_info.py` file, we see the entire `phase_info` dictionary that we just defined.\n",
    "This is a verbose data object that exposes most of the mission definition parameters that Aviary uses.\n",

    "### Discussing the problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run Aviary, let's discuss what we're asking it to do.\n",
    "We are asking Aviary to fly the prescribed mission using the least amount of fuel possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are holding the prescribed Mach and altitude values fixed, but allowing the optimizer to control the time spent in each phase.\n",
    "To be verbose, in the climb phase the aircraft must start at the initial altitude and Mach values and reach the cruise Mach and altitude values.\n",
    "How long it takes to do that is up to the optimizer.\n",
    "The same is true for the cruise-climb and descent phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `simple` mission definition, the throttle value of the propulsion system is solved for by the Aviary model.\n",
    "This means that the optimizer will determine the throttle value that allows the aircraft to fly the prescribed mission while minimizing fuel burn across the mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could allow the optimizer to control the Mach and altitude values as well.\n",
    "By checking the appropriate boxes in the GUI or by setting the `optimize_mach` or `optimize_altitude` flags to `True` in the `phase_info` dict, Aviary will find the best Mach and altitude values for each phase.\n",
    "There are many more options available to expose to the optimizer here that allow us to control the mission definition.\n",
    "We will discuss more of these options in other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Aviary using the Python interface\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You will see a lot of output when running Aviary. This is normal and expected. We purposefully provide a large amount of information, which is often useful when debugging or understanding your model.\n",
